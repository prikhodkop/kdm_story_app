There was once a boy and a girl, who met under the blanket of darkness and counted the lights in the sky together.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:26,000
When their lips touched, the sun dawned for the first time. "I have a crazy dream to share with you." said the girl. "We will hunt down that light and live under it, together, forever."

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
"I swear to you we'll live that dream together." said the boy. He felt the promise swell in his heart.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The girl and the boy grew into man and woman. Together, they cooked many meals, repaired weapons, fought monsters, and gave up on starting a family.

00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Although their childhood promise was forgotten with the passage of time, they shared a great love. But one day, the woman fell ill.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:16,000
As they lay counting the lights in the sky like they always had, the sun finally dawned again. Excitedly, the man turned to the woman, but she had stopped counting some time ago.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Beneath the warmth of the sun, he kissed her cold body goodbye, and remembered their promise. He decided that he would hunt the sun, so that he may bury it with her.
