00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A low, constant rumble woke a woman sleeping on the ground. She quietly shifted her bedding aside and lowered her ear to the ground. Something strange was happening out in the darkness.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In a breathless moment, the woman's wonder overcame her fear and she set out to find the source of the tremors underfoot.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The woman followed her feet, feeling her way toward the rumble until it became a quake.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Ahead she saw a peculiar figure struggling to push massive sphere up a hill. The object appeared quite heavy and the creature faltered often, losing ground.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Each time it did, it redoubled its efforts and rolled the massive weight back up the hill, shaking the ground anew.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
At first glance, the struggle appeared clumsy and pathetic, but as she watched, the woman was taken by the creature's unrelenting perseverance.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Even after the monster crested the hill and vanished, its noble form and simple mission stayed with her. Admiration was too weak a word to describe her feelings.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The woman quietly stole back into the settlement, waking no one. Although the others slept soundly, she remained awake, invigorated by witnessing such dedication and exertion.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She searched the settlement for the smoothest object she could find and began to roll it, emulating the monster. She would teach the settlement its ways, and show them perfect persistence.
