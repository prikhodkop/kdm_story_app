Once upon a time, there was a place of carved stone faces. A man with a lantern lay sleeping a dreamless sleep. The man new nothing.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:36,500
One day, the man woke up. He rubbed dried ink caked over his eyes and opened them. Around him, he saw other people stirring, and beyond, a horizon of unbroken darkness.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:53,000
A woman approached the man with the lantern. Her soft hand reached out to him. They had no words. They were a mystery to each other.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Suddenly, a monster emerged from the darkness, its eyes wild with hunger. It attacked.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The people were no match for the monster. It tore their flesh and crushed their bones between its teeth. Some, it devoured whole.

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Overcome with terror and grief, the man with the lantern collapsed to the ground. Cold stone noses pushed into his side. There was no escape.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But the man did not want to die. Desperately grasping at the cold stone faces, he felt a crack, and tore at it with all his might. A piece of stone came free. It was sharp and deadly.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The man with the lantern scrambled to his feet, his weapon clenched in his fist. He took a deep breath and roared into the darkness.

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Somewhere in the place of stone faces, nameless men and women stand together. They have nothing but a need to survive and a lantern to light their struggle.`,
