Past the velvet curtain of inky blackness covering the world, past the inevitability of death, there lies a young girl, ostracized for her unique perspective.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Every so often a lantern in the hoard would be snuffed by some unseen force. This snuffing of the lanterns was a curious event for the girl, and she dedicated much time to admiring the great protector of her settlement, alone.

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One year, when the light was extinguished, the girl noticed that it was not extinguished at all, but had drifted off into the darkness. As she peered past the inky veil at the edge of the settlement, she could see the pale light of a lantern!

00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then, another lantern. And another. And another! Until the sky was blanketed in soft, ghostly lanterns. The soft lights illuminated the settlement with a foreign light, waking its sleeping denizens. Panic descended upon the settlers, as the nature of these floating lanterns was foreign to them.

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But the girl, as curious as she was wise, studied these floating lanterns, and listened. They sung to her of a very quiet, very lonely girl living in the darkness. A girl who needed a friend.
