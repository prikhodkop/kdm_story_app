00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Suddenly, the mutilated body of a fellow survivor hangs in the center of the settlement, their life snuffed out and put on display in a horrific fashion.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Your ears become flush with a dull ring, and panic and fear creep into your mind as you struggle to comprehend what just happened.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A tall, grim stranger stands before you, with eyes deeper and blacker than any you've seen. In its hand, a lantern with a distorted face emits a piercing light and a deep reverberation that fills the folds in your brain.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:01,000
With slow, soundless steps, the stranger advances. You call out in fright, but find you cannot speak. The only sounds that can be heard within the light of the bizarre lantern are those emanating from it.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Outside of the light, no one notices the stranger. They talk in shocked and frightened tones around the hanging corpse, unaware of the danger lurking behind them.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Within this soundless, reverberating pocket of light, you bear witness to something even more frightening than the events leading up to this moment.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The deranged survivor stands limp, their face staring blankly at the ground and the faces in the ground staring blankly back at them. Sensing something amiss, the grim stranger stops its approach just inches from deranged survivor.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You can't hear it, but you can feel it - a confident laughter that splits the deranged survivor's face nearly in half. You are filled with a desperate wonder as you watch them find something terrible and dark within themselves.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Transformed by the intensity of the situation, the deranged survivor's expression is forever changed. You are unsure whether to feel afraid of them or envious.
