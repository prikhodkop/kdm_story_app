00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The survivor paused in the darkness, crippled by an unknown feeling of loss. Their eyes swelled with inexplicable tears. A hole opened in their heart.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A warm hand slipped into the survivor's. Looking up, they saw something they never expected.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Although the survivor could not understand the stranger's words, they saw the truth in the stranger's eyes. They felt an identical hole in the stranger's heart. The survivor wanted nothing more than to protect her. Hand in hand, they returned to the settlement.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Lying in each other's embrace, they felt the warmth of love fill their hearts and wrap around them. Together, they dreamed a perfect dream.

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
They dreamed of the future. They dreamed of fulfillment. They dreamed of a life together.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:27,000
When the dream ended, the stranger awoke with a cry. They stranger's stomach was full and she was alone. She felt something she did not want to accept, something she would forget over and over again.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The hole in her heart could never be filled.

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
