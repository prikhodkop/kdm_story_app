Once, there were two boys. They argued about everything.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
As the boys grew into men, their enmity bloomed into rivalry. With each hard-earned battle scar, they sought to outdo each other.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One day, one of the boys did not return from a hunt. The remaining boy felt no victory over his rival,  only the loss of a friend. Unable to find him in the world, he refused to leave his bed, hoping to see him in his dreams.

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Time passed, until one day he felt a strange vibration. Then, he heard the familiar voice of his lost friend just outside his hovel! He rushed outside, only to see decaying body of his friend swaying awkwardly in the air.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Horrified, he heard a dry rasping that could only be laugh. For a moment, the monster was revealed before it vanished intro the dark, whisking the corpse puppet away.
