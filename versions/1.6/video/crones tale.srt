00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
One day, the surivors gathered around an old crone that had decided to share a secret.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In her foolish youth, she had played inside a foul-smelling, carved ball. Before she knew what had happened, the ball rolled away with her trapped inside. She tumbled in stomach-churning darkness for what seemed like days.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The ball rolled to a sudden halt. She crawled out into a hushed glade. Strange plants twisted up beetween her grasping fingers and bloomed in lurid colors.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It came soundlessly from the trees, thorny flowering vines burst from the ground where it tread, and the glade was aglow from its strange light.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The survivors followed her into the dark. Along the way she told them of the glade's seductive beauty and the wondrous creature that guarded it.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Finally, they reached a gleaming gate that set the keen survivors' teeth on edge, at once repulsing and pulling at something deep in the pits of their stomachs.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The crone stood before it, determined. Her old skin sagged further and her eyes filled with pain as the gates swung open.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Painfully, the crone led them through the shifting forest to the glade. There, on its downy grasses, she lay down. The survivors gathered worriedly around her.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:58,000
With her final breath, a ghostly glowing flower burst from her papery lips, its delicate bloom fragrant with untold power.
