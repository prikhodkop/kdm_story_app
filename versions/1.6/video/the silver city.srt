Once, there was a boy that loved his mother. When she felt ill, he stayed at her bedside every night, entranced by her tall tales of a silver god living alone in an ancient city buried deep underground.

When elders were not watching, he would steal into the darkness in search of the lost Silver City. The boy knew that if he found the silver god from his mother's stories, he would tell him how to make her better so she could hunt once again.

One day, the boy saw a silver lantern flying through the air.

He chased it deep into the darkness. The lantern vanished into a crack, and the boy followed it.

When he finally emerged, he saw it. Spread out before him were the ruins of a strange city. The walls and floors were covered in strange silver writing that his lantern light reflected off of. "The silver god must be close!" he thought, and ran home excitedly to tell his mother.

Sadly, she passed while he was gone. No one believed his story about the strange city or the silver god.
